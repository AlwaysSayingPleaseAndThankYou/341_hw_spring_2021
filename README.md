# 341_hw_spring_2021
Hw for Dr Sekhars Spring 2021 signals and systems class. 
Based on the textbook "signals and systems labratory with MATLAB" by Alex Palamadies and Anastasia Veloni. 

Course outcomes:

1-  b. Evaluate and classify signals to identify unstable systems. 
1-  c. Use Laplace, Z, and Fourier transforms to obtain the frequency domain models to represent signals and systems. 
1-  d. Applies probability and statistics in analyzing random signals. 
3-  a. Produce MATLAB based lab reports with discipline-specific conventions. 
7-  c. Apply new knowledge to understand continuous and discrete systems. 

Final Grade: A
